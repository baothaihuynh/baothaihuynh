- 🔍 With two years of experience working as an accountant for a retail chain in Ho Chi Minh City, I have been exposed to huge amounts of data every day and have since nurtured a deep passion for the field of data analysis. I am looking for an entry-level Data Analyst position to apply for and further develop my data analytics expertise, which I have acquired through both academic and professional endeavors.
